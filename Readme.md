Fixed Green face in wrong location

Moved Cube to 0,0,0 so rotation is centered

Trying to get a button to work on a HUD/CanvasLayer

Added ability to press buttons to get different cube sizes

Added back button to go back to cube selection screen

Added black backdrop to cube

To create outline of section to be turned, can make series of meshes that outline the section

Could also create rotating axis that changes depending on rotation of cube, so axes of rotation always clear

Maybe should also put camera at ground level, so rotation is more intuitive
